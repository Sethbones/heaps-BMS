this document is for the hypothetical editor

scenes being their own seperate files are a neccesity
you can't assign coordinates for objects as is, sure you can run a custom script with a custom file format like tiled maps
but you run into the same issue, something is still needed for map coordinates

currently coordinates for objects are assigned by either manually creating a map format or using tiled with the (currently borked) importer

so why not simplify the process?

scn files have an object tree of what to spawn and in what order
as well as locations to spawn each of them
the object specific variables can just be done by the object itself

as for tiles and maps
since there's a visual editor, tilegroups can just be created dynamically
