the main issue is:
do i make it a web app and potentially cripple the performance for the sake of beauty or find a way to load the engine through something like flutter
or heck maybe i would even need to write my own framework, don't know right now

this is like an end goal for the engine, so this folder will likely stay empty for years
for now Tiled is a good option
