//this "nuclear option" is called fixedUpdate, and should be implemented soon
//for reference, i didn't know how fixedUpdate worked, and so in just doing this, i accidentally figured out exactly how fixedUpdate works
new way to to animation rendering:

only move to next frame if a threshold is reached

as in, instead of just moving in random arbitrary numbers
instead if it needs to move every like 5ms, getting a variable to count up to 5 to then say okay its done and move to next frame.
this is a nuclear option however, but it will solve the problem of having a frame be skipped completely because the number generated by the animationTimer runs over it due to frame rate

this will cause other problems though, as lets say you play at a low frame rate and it takes over 5ms to render the next frame, so the animationTimer will generate an absurdly high number, and it will only move to the next frame.
again, nuclear option.


another option is to clamp the current number to the nearest integer to have a flatter playback that avoids most issues



the problems that come in:
animationTimer spits out:
(1/frameRate) * 1000
so that means:
66.67 ms | 15hz
33.33 ms | 30hz
16.67 ms | 60hz
6.944 ms | 144hz
4.167 ms | 240hz
2.778 ms | 360hz
2.083 ms | 480hz
1.667 ms | 600hz | this will likely be the cap soon, beyond this point comes deminishing returns
0.833 ms | 1200hz

now you see where the timing problem comes in, what if the animation needs to run a script at a hyper specific frame

note that for a majority of usecases you're going to want a 60FPS cap
