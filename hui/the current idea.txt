soon

the current idea is to move all h2d parts that are ui related to this folder, create a render layer by the name of sui/rnd, and essentially splitting 2d game and ui

this is intended to depretzel the work flow, keeping everything that matters where it belongs instead of creating a mess in combining ui and game work
